# Igor
Python Robotics Library for RaspberryPI 4*

Igor is a library of various methods to animate LEDs, actuators, motors, solenoids 
in a way that might be used in robotics and express natural looking "Styles" to these
elements. As an example, configure your GPOIs for your LED eyes and control them with
commands, like "wake up", "stare", "go to sleep", "act suprised", "act shy" and
configure the blink rate.

The goal is to create natural looking behaviour with "Igor-Styles".

This is a work in progress and experimental.
