# Igor
Python Robotics Library for RaspberryPI

Igor is a library of various methods to animate LEDs, actuators, motors, solenoids 
in a way that might be used in robotics and express natural looking behaviour (Igor Styles) to these
elements. As an example, configure your GPOIs for your LED eyes and control the emotion with
style commands, like "wake_up", "stare", "go_to_sleep", "act_suprised", "act_shy", all using a
combination of brightness and eye blink rate to express the desired animation.

This is a work in progress and experimental.
