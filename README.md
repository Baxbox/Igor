# Igor
Python Robotics Library for RaspberryPI

Igor is a library of various methods to animate LEDs, actuators, 
motors, solenoids in a way that might be used in robotics to 
express natural looking behaviour (Igor Emotes) to these
elements. As an example, configure your GPOIs IDs for your LED eyes and control the emotion with an Igor-Style command, like "wake_up", "stare", "go_to_sleep", "act_suprised", "act_shy", all controlled by a combination of brightness and eye blink rate to emote the expressive animation.

This is a work in progress and experimental.
